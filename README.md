# Team UNiDOsX // UNiDOsX Engine

This engine has been developed to make the process of developing terminal-based games easier and more efficient. The motivation behind is from KitsuVM's experience developing these types of games for the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) events in 2024 and 2026.
